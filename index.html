    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <p>The Shopware Bootstrap Theme combines the extensibility of Shopware and the simplicity of Bootstrap. With these assets in your pocket, developing innovative themes for e-commerce becomes as easy as never before.</p>
    <h2>Reusable Responsive Components</h2>
    <p>@media { max-width: 480px; }… how was it again? Worry not; Bootstrap already took care of this. Readymade classes let you realise your ideas without any effort, for all devices, fully responsive. We follow Bootstrap's approach – devices are categorised in viewport width ranges, from extra-small under which most handheld phones fall, to extra-large, like your high resolution desktop. Never was it more straightforward to stretch that button over an iPhone's full width, tuck it into the top-right corner of your tablet, while hiding it completely on your ultra-wide-screen work station; this behaviour and much more is just few elementary class names away!</p>
